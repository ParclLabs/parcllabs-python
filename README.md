###  Examples

We maintain a repository of examples that demonstrate how to use the Parcl Labs API for analysis. You can find the examples in the [Parcl Labs Examples](https://github.com/parcllabs/parcllabs-examples)

## Getting Started

### Step 1. Sign Up for an API Key

To use the Parcl Labs API, you need an API key. To get an API key, sign up at [ParclLabs](https://dashboard.parcllabs.com/signup). In the subsequent examples, the API key is stored in the `PARCLLABS_API_KEY` environment variable.



### Step 2. Installation

You can install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install parcllabs
```


### Step 3. Usage

The `ParclLabsClient` class is the entry point to the Parcl Labs API. You can use the client to access methods that allow you to retrieve and analyze data from the Parcl Labs API. You'll need to pass in your API key when you create an instance of the `ParclLabsClient` class.

```python
import os

from parcllabs import ParclLabsClient


api_key = os.getenv('PARCL_LABS_API_KEY')
client = ParclLabsClient(api_key)
```

#### Search
Search is your entry point into finding one or many of over 70,000 markets in the United States. You can search for markets by `name`, `state`, `region`, `fips`, or `zip code`. You can also search for markets by their unique `parcl_id`.

##### Search Markets
```python
# get top 2 metros by population
markets = client.search.markets.retrieve(
        location_type='CBSA',
        sort_by='TOTAL_POPULATION',
        sort_order='DESC',
        limit=2
)
# top 2 metros based on population. We will use these markets to query other services in the remainder of this readme
top_market_parcl_ids = markets['parcl_id'].tolist()
# parcl_id country  geoid state_fips_code                                   name state_abbreviation region location_type  total_population  median_income  parcl_exchange_market  pricefeed_market  case_shiller_10_market  case_shiller_20_market

```

#### Services

Services are the core of the Parcl Labs API. They provide access to a wide range of data and analytics on the housing market. The services are divided into the following categories: `Price Feeds`, `Rental Market Metrics`, `For Sale Market Metrics`, `Market Metrics`, `Investor Metrics`, and `Portfolio Metrics`.

#### Price Feeds
The Parcl Labs Price Feed (PLPF) is a daily-updated, real-time indicator of residential real estate prices, measured by price per square foot, across select US markets.

The Price Feeds category allows you to access our daily-updated PLPF and derivative metrics, such as volatility.

##### Price Feed
Gets the daily price feed for a specified `parcl_id`.

##### Price Feed Volatility
Gets the daily price feed volatility for a specified `parcl_id`.

##### Rental Price Feed
Gets the daily updated Parcl Labs Rental Price Feed for a given `parcl_id`.

```python
# get 2 price feeds trading on the Parcl Exchange
pricefeed_markets = client.search.markets.retrieve(
        sort_by='PARCL_EXCHANGE_MARKET', # use PRICEFEED_MARKET for all price feed markets
        sort_order='DESC',
        limit=2
)
# top 2 metros based on population. We will use these markets to query other services in the remainder of this readme
pricefeed_ids = pricefeed_markets['parcl_id'].tolist()
start_date = '2024-06-01'
end_date = '2024-06-05'

price_feeds = client.price_feed.price_feed.retrieve(
    parcl_ids=pricefeed_ids,
    start_date=start_date,
    end_date=end_date
)
rental_price_feeds = client.price_feed.rental_price_feed.retrieve(
    parcl_ids=pricefeed_ids,
    start_date=start_date,
    end_date=end_date
)
price_feed_volatility = client.price_feed.volatility.retrieve(
    parcl_ids=pricefeed_ids,
    start_date=start_date,
    end_date=end_date
)

# want to save to csv? Use .to_csv method as follow:
# price_feeds.to_csv('price_feeds.csv', index=False)
# rental_price_feeds.to_csv('rental_price_feeds.csv', index=False)
# price_feed_volatility.to_csv('price_feed_volatility.csv', index=False)
```

#### Rental Market Metrics
